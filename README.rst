Python module for reading and writing `Apache ORC`_ file format. It uses the Apache ORC's Core C++ API
under the hood, and provides a similar interface as the `csv module`_ in the Python standard library.

Supports only Python 3.6 or newer and ORC 1.6.

Features
--------

- Reading ORC files.
- Writing ORC files.
- While using Python's stream/file-like object IO interface.

That sums up quite well the purpose of this project.

Example
-------

Minimal example for reading an ORC file:

.. code:: python

        import pyorc

        with open("./data.orc", "rb") as data:
            reader = pyorc.Reader(data)
            for row in reader:
                print(row)

And another for writing one:

.. code:: python

        import pyorc

        with open("./new_data.orc", "wb") as data:
            with pyorc.Writer(data, "struct<col0:int,col1:string>") as writer:
                writer.write((1, "ORC from Python"))

Reading from commandline:

`python3 -c "import pyorc; import sys; print(list(pyorc.Reader(open(sys.argv[1],'rb'))))"  file.orc`
